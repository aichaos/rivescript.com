# Chat Clients

## HexChat

This is a plugin built for XChat (not tested on HexChat, but should probably work)
that uses the Perl RiveScript module.

It appears to turn your HexChat client into a bot of some sort. I wrote this years
ago (2010), haven't tried it recently, don't fully remember how it works.
