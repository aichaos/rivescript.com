<h1>RiveScript-Enabled Chatbots</h1>

Here are some complete chatbot applications that use RiveScript as their
back-end "brain" and bridge RiveScript to a chat interface of some kind, such as
an instant messenger.<p>

Want your chatbot project featured? <a href="/contact">Contact me</a> and I'll
add you to this page! The only requirement is that your project has to use
RiveScript!

<h1>Aires Bot</h1>

Aires is a multi-protocol, multi-brained chatbot with support for connecting a
chatbot to AOL Instant Messenger and XMPP (through which a bot could be signed
on to Google Hangouts or Facebook Messenger via their XMPP interfaces).<p>

It's designed with a plugin architecture so that adding new protocol interfaces
or back-end bot brains is easy. It comes with support built-in for RiveScript as
a back-end brain.<p>
