"""Bootstrap script to set up a local dev instance of RiveScript.com

This will `git clone` an instance of the Rophako CMS and configure it to run
this local website. When the dev Rophako instance already exists, running this
script again acts as a shortcut to running `python runserver.py` from within
the Rophako git repo.

This script is only designed to work in Python 3 and requires the `git` and
`pyvenv` commands.

This performs the following tasks:
* Clones Rophako into ./rophako
* Sets up a Python 3 virtual environment via `pyvenv` at ./rophako/pyvenv
* Installs requirements via `pip` into its virtual environment
* Symlinks settings.yml and rivescript_legacy.py into the Rophako root
* Runs the server
